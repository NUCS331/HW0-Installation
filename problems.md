# Homework 0 - Setting up and learning how to submit a good report

Each assignment will consist of a coding and writing task. In the initial homework the coding and writing tasks are very simple. They should help you getting started with everything.

# Coding Task

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb)
2. Implement the missing functions ( that show a `NotImplementedError` when running) in the `src` folder as indicated inside the jupyter notebook
3. Add, commit and push your implementations to your GitHub repository. 
4. Make sure that the commits are updated on your github repository **on Time before the due date**. Grades have access to your commit history and will judge according to this. The graders will check if you have an implementation in your repository and if you fail this, this will count as a direct fail.

#  Writing Task
All reports have to be submitted as .PDF created using the Overleaf report template we provide to you. Open now the overleaf template from here and create your own copy to start your report for homework 0.

Latex is not hard, however, if you've never used Latex before, and can be a bit overwhelming. It is a very different experience to Word and more like writing HTML. Here are a few links that might help you getting started in case you struggle with it:

2. http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/skills/documents/3722/3722-2014.pdf

**First**, please fill out all the information on the top of the document. This means you have to include your name, e-mail adress, netid, github name and the weblink to *your* assignment repository on GitHub. You'll have to do this for every homework throughout the quarter. Failing doing so will lead to an immediate fail of the assignment.

In general, all scientific papers are written in a very technical style. This means, there is an abstract, an introduction, a methods, an result and conclusion section. Throughout this quarter, we are trying to apapt the technical paper writing style for all report. 

Luckily, Latex allows you to implement and write these sections without ever having to worry about the design of your document, since Latex is doing it all for you. In order to learn Latex and how to submit the PDF, for passing Homework 0 you will have to generate a small example report on the topic of *Computational Photography*.

Tasks:
### 1. Write a small abstract
Your abstract should *describe in your own word* what this class is about. For this you can revisit the first lecture or use google to find information.

In about 4-5 sentences your abstract should answer e.g. the following questions:
1. What is Computational Photography?
2. Why are scienticts/engineers/industry interested in Computational Photography? Can you name a few examples?

### 2. Write a small introduction
The introduction is usually a small overview into the topic. Often abstract and introduction are a bit redundant. The introduction should motivate the problem, showcase why it might be important, find possible applications of a technique/method and outline the content of the paper.

Please write in *your own words* a few sentences (about 10 to 15 sentences) about
1. What do you think are the differences between Computational Photography, Optics, Computer Graphics and Computer Vision ?
2. What do you think are important skills/tools to have when you work in Computional Photography?
3. Why did you decide to take Computational Photography? Are you a photographer? Do you have experience in Computer Vision? Do you like imaging? 

### 3. Methods - include a few optics formula that you think might be important in computational photography
As the name says, the methods section describe the proposed method in detail. After the methods section a reader needs to understand what methology is used throughout a paper. This will be important for a few assignemnts, where we want you to describe in your own words how a method works. This ensures that you have actually understood what we are asking you to implement. Note, that the methods sections doesn't motivate the problem which should be already done prior.

Since this is the first homework, there is nothing to write about. In order to practice your latex skills, please include a few (2-3) important equations that you know remember about optics/engineering/signal procesing from previous classes that you think might become important in Computational Photography. [This link](https://www.newport.com/n/optics-formulas),[Link 2](https://www.dummies.com/education/science/physics/optics-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/) might help you to fresh your memory. For each quation reference the equation in your writing and include 1-2 sentence what this formula is saying and why you think this might be important. If there is a simple image which illustrates the formula (e.g. the lensmaker formula) please include this formula in your report. In case your re-using a public picture, make sure to cite and put it into the references (For both papers and websites).

### Results
This homework doesn't have any results section. However, please show evidence that you've succesfully installed git, conda and JupyterLab.

Include 2 or 3 images that clearly show that you've accomplished this task for homework 0. This is meant to be a pratice of your latex skills. Please do not include images which are large and unreadible, but instead use cropped images (that show the essential information) as well as Latex subplots to avoid long and large reports!

### Conclusion
This section concludes the report. Since there's really not much to conclude for homework 0, please answer the following question on course logistics to make sure you've undestood them. All information should be found on the course website, 

1. What and how do you have to submit for successfull homework submission?
2. How is each assignment graded?
3. How is the course graded?
