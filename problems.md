Each assignment will consist of a coding and writing task. In the initial homework the coding and writing tasks are very simple. They should help you getting started with everything.

# Coding Task

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb)
2. Implement the missing function in the `src` folder as indicated inside the jupyter notebook
3. Add, commit and push your implementations to `git`
4. Make sure that the commits are updated on your github repository. The graders will check if you have an implementation in your repository

#  Writing Task

Open the overleaf template from here and create your own copy of the report for homework 0.

Latex is not hard, however, if you've never used Latex before, and can be quite hard. Here are a few links that might help you getting started
1. https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes
2. http://www.docs.is.ed.ac.uk/skills/documents/3722/3722-2014.pdf

First, please fill out all the information on the top of the document. This means you have to include your name, e-mail adress, netid, github name and the link to *your* assignment repository on Github. You'll have to do this for every homework throughout the quarter.

Usually, scientific papers are written in a very technical style. This means, there is an abstract, an introduction, a methods, an result and conclusion section. Throughout this quarter, we are trying to apapt the technical paper writing style for all report.

Latex allows you to implement and write these sections without ever having to worry about design, Latex is doing all for you. In order to learn Latex and how to submit the PDF, you will have to generate a small example report on Computational Photography.

Tasks:
### 1. Write a small abstract
Your abstract should *describe in your own word* what this class is about. For this you can revisit the first lecture or use google to find information.

In about 4-5 sentences your abstract should answer the following important questions:
1. What is Computational Photography?
2. Why are people interested in Computational Photography?

### 2. Write a small introduction
The introduction is usually a soft overview into the topic. Often abstract and introduction are very redundant. Please write in *your own words* a few sentences (~7-15 sentences) about
1. What do you think are the differences between Computational Photography, Optics, Computer Graphics and Computer Vision ?
2. What do you think are important skills to have when you work in Computional Photography?
3. Why did you decide to take Computational Photography? Are you a photographer? Do you have experience in Computer Vision? Do you like imaging? 

### 3. Methods - include a few optics formula that might become important in computational photography
Usually, the methods section describe a method. After the methods section a reader needs to understand what methology is used in a paper. This will be important for a few assignemnts, where we want you to describe in your own words how a method works.

Since this is the first homework, there is nothing to write about. In order to practice your latex skills, please include a few (2-3) important equations that you know remember about optics/engineering/signal procesing from previous classes that you think might become important in Computational Photography. [This link](https://www.newport.com/n/optics-formulas),[Link 2](https://www.dummies.com/education/science/physics/optics-for-dummies-cheat-sheet/) might help you to fresh your memory. For each quation reference the equation in your writing and include 1-2 sentence what this formula is saying and why you think this might be important!
